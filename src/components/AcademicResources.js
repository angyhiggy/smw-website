                                    <p>As engineering students, we get a lot of work thrown our way. It is important to realize which tasks are of high priority, and what can be put off temporarily. Each night, write down what you wish to accomplish and number them into a list in order of highest to lowest priority. By beginning with what's most important, you will experience less stress if you are not able to finish everything - the less important work you didn't finish can be carried over to the next day!</p>

Dedicate a couple of hours each night for doing homework, reviewing lecture notes, completing labs, etc. Get into a daily routine of doing this and you will experience less pressure before midterms and assignment due dates. This will also lighten your workload on weekends, giving you time to enjoy other activities.</p>

Rather than writing down: <em>"Study from 3-5"</em>, try: <em>"Do calculus problems from 3-5"</em>.<br />- When allocating time, always overestimate the time you think it will take to finish something.<br /><b>REMEMBER:</b> Try your best to follow your set schedule, but know that you will not be able to follow it to the minute. It is important to know how to<br /> re-adjust and recover!</p>

                        <p>Although multi-tasking may seem like a good way to get things done, it makes it very difficult to maintain efficiency. Try putting all your focus towards one task for a set period of time. When you have accomplished your goal, move on to the next task. This will eliminate distraction and allow you to work at an efficent pace! </p>

                        <p>Studies have shown that studying/focusing in short time intervals with short breaks in between can maximize work efficiency. A great way to practice this is the <b>POMODORO TECHNIQUE</b>. Here is a brief description of how it works:<br />
            - Pick a task, and work on it for 25 minutes (this will be your first Pomodoro).<br />
            - Once the 25 minutes are over, take a 5 minute break.
            - Repeat until you have completed 4 pomodoros - at this point take a 20-30 minute break.<br />
            - Keep repeating the entire cycle until you reach the end of your study period!<br />

                        <p>If you're struggling with focusing, a good start is eliminating all distractions. Turn your notifications off and don't check your phone until you take a break. If you still feel too tempted to look at your phone, put it in another room before you start studying!</p>

                        <p>Every time you sit down to get work done, decide on the time you will stop working. This creates a sense of urgency and forces you to work as efficiently as possible. You will start to find that tasks aren't being dragged out longer than they should be and are being completed right away.</p>

                        <p>Working in a messy workspace can make it hard to focus - always keep your area tidy and only keep what you're currently working on out. Minimize distractions - only use your computer if you have to, and close any unnecessary tabs while you are working. </p>

                        <p>As humans, we spend lots of time "waiting around" throughout the day. Some examples include:<br /><br />
            - Waiting for your laundry to finish<br />
            - One hour breaks in between classes<br />
            - Commuting to/from campus<br />
                            <br />
            Use times like these to get something done - whether it's studying, exercising, or calling family! Doing this will help maximize your time throughout the day and eliminate wasted time.

                        <p>Staying up all night is not the way to get things done as its not sustainable and will just make you more tired. Our bodies need sleep to function properly, so don't deprive yourself from it! Aim to get <b>AT LEAST</b> 7 hours of sleep on <b>MOST</b> nights. This will help you stay energized throughout the week, allowing you to work better.</p>

                        <p>Create a reward system for yourself with things you enjoy. For example - every night you finish everything on your to-do list, you're allowed to watch 1-2 episodes of your favourite TV show. Other things to reward yourself can include shopping, a night out with friends, self-care, or anything else you can think of. Most importantly, don't feel guilty while doing this - you deserve it! </p>
