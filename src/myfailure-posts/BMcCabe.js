                Failures take many forms and have many outcomes. One of my ongoing failures is that I’ve always had a very difficult time remembering names. Even when I was seven, I recall meeting someone new and having to ask them many times what their name was. Forty years later when I became Department Chair, I decided that I was going to fix this weakness once and for all. I bought a book that was recommended by the Rotman School of Management called The Memory Bible, and settled down to read it. The author suggested a method of repeating names several times when you first meet someone. I was about 1/3 of the way through the book when the inevitable happened. I lost the book. I couldn’t remember where I left it! BUT, I remembered its name. 

                I still can’t remember the names of everyone I meet, especially when it is a group of people and I don’t have an opportunity to get to know them as individuals. I’ve developed methods to write down names and notes as soon as I can after the introduction, but it is still a struggle and embarrassing. Who are you again?
