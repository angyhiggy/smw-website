                    Ten months ago, our lives were altered forever. The COVID-19 pandemic hit, and with it came policies of social distancing that made us feel emotionally distant. We - the student population - could not spend late nights in campus libraries laughing together as we attempted to do assignments. We could not go out on Fridays, reflecting on the week behind us and the week ahead. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet, social media has emerged as a source of community to promote online discussion and connection. It is a luxury that was not afforded to students living through the 1918 H1N1 pandemic. They could neither send zoom links nor set virtual backgrounds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can take advantage of social media to connect with one another through the COVID-19 pandemic. As undergraduate students from the University of Toronto, Waterloo and Queen’s, we reached out to students to learn about mental health through the COVID-19 pandemic.

                </p>
                <h3><b>WHAT ARE THE SOURCES OF PAIN?</b></h3>
                <p>We wanted to answer some key questions and put together a diverse team of students to support others. What is causing the pain? Is it loneliness and isolation? Virtual school exhaustion?</p>

                <p>It is easy to feel unmotivated and unproductive during this pandemic. Our diverse socio-demographic backgrounds have led to disparate outcomes in the classroom and elsewhere during the remote university experience.</p>

                <p>Acknowledge that everyone’s position in this pandemic is different. Some will have worries that others will not. The point is not to compare but to support one another and persevere together. This pandemic has been especially difficult for people with pre-existing or newly emerged mental health disorders such as anxiety, depression, and addiction, often arising due to isolation, change and ambiguity.</p>

                <p>Exacerbating these deeply set issues are home-life conditions like separation from family members, poverty, and in many cases abuse and neglect that are now much more difficult to escape. We have closed our doors to one another without creating new spaces to support and thrive.</p>

                <p>While we have been provided more “free time” by being able to watch lectures at 1.5x speedit is easy for students to fill that free-time with work. Social interactions and mental health promotions become second priorities.</p>

                <p>Some students view the pandemic as a hindrance towards their professional career. Whether it was a lost internship or a seemingly decreased quality of education, students feel a build up of pressure to get the “labels” that industry has promoted as being valuable, but are now less attainable.</p>

                <p>Students even fear “pre-pandemic life” vanishing. There’s a feeling that the pandemic, initially viewed possibly as a short-term situation, has changed social dynamics forever.</p>

                <p>There’s a stronger feeling that social interactions once perceived as potentially normal or exhilarating will now be relics of the past, and that we will lose the opportunity to experience.</p>

                <p>Some students feel as though academic institutions have made little effort to address student mental health over the past years. This issue has once again come to the forefront as student mental health has suffered over the past 10 months due to  the transition to online school. </p>


                <h3><b>WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE OURSELVES STRONGER?</b></h3>

                <p>We wanted to get a better sense of students’ actions to support their mental health.</p>

                <p>Of the 30 students we surveyed, 61% have tried a new hobby through the pandemic. 79% have commented on virtual calls being a critical component to supporting their mental health, 68% work out and 32% care less about their academic performance in school. </p>

                <p>We feel strongly about setting short term goals (daily even) that are realistic and regularly attainable. Something as simple as making it to virtual class on time, to getting some outdoor activities once a day. In doing so, we can focus on only a few things at a time instead of feeling overwhelmed, and to celebrate frequent morale-boosting victories.</p>

                <p>Instead of filling up your “free-time” with work, fill that time with activities that will support your mental health. Even if online school physically overlaps with personal life, make time for yourself. Just as a student would put a lab or lecture in their schedule, they should apply the same principle of commitment to their own mental health. Everyone is fighting this pandemic together, and we are stronger when socially connected.</p>

                <p>Just remember, we are going through one of history's most severe events. If 20 years from now someone asks you what you did through the pandemic to “survive”, think not only about your physical health, but also your mental health.</p>

                <p>The key to “survival” is to focus on what is in front of you, not behind. During this time, it's easy to look behind and feel guilty over past choices, and this can take a mental toll. Focus on the future.</p>

                <p>Acknowledge that we will get through this pandemic. When the world was suffering through a period of political strife and the threat of nuclear war, we managed to find ways to maintain and grow communities when tomorrow was not a guarantee. Although we hope that some of the highlights of pre-pandemic life will return, we want to take advantage of the opportunity the pandemic has provided to develop new norms and experiences during the prime of our university life.</p>

                <p>Find areas in which you can feel fulfilled. Many students have been misled to believe that marks are the only way to be fulfilled in a university environment, and as a result we tend to conflate our sense of self-worth with grades. We believe that finding fulfilment beyond academic performance can improve mental health, such as fulfillment in helping others, fulfillment in taking care of yourself, or fulfilment of a hobby. </p>

                <p>The current pandemic is not ‘the new normal’. Changes in our lives should be met with changes in expectations of ourselves. Success can be found in small actions and in maintaining your mental health.</p>

                <p>Since connection is what we are craving, find ways to root yourself in your situation and branch out to others who need your support and who can support you. This can be as informal as a game of Among Us or as dedicated as creating an online book club amongst peers. </p>

                <p>We’ve been sold the narrative year after year that the world is becoming smaller, the internet is connecting us all. It doesn’t often feel that way. It’s easier to hide behind screens than to reach out for help. But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible to try.</p>

                <p>Start somewhere small and comfortable and grow from those strong roots when you are ready to. And above all, <b>remember that there are people who care about you.</b> A community of people crazy enough to be in university that are willing to talk you through common hardships. Although you may feel trapped, growing deficient in the social nutrients we have come to rely on, we can still find new ways to grow.</p>

                <p>If COVID-19 brought us one good thing, that is to make sure that you should always stay in touch and connect with the people around you. Checking in on someone shouldn’t only happen during a global pandemic, it should happen regardless of the circumstances. Because even small conversations, like “hey, how’re you doing” could make a major impact in another person’s life.</p>

                <p>Consider moments where you may have appreciated someone reaching out, even to say hi, and do the same for others. Although interactions are online, virtual connections can allow you to foster new friendships and reconnect with old friends.</p>

                <p>
                    <b>Summary of Actions:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Find a new hobby</li>
                        <li>- Try to get exercise, bonus points for time spent outside</li>
                        <li>- Connect with friends virtually or by following public health precautions in person.</li>
                        <li>- Spend your “free-time” on mental health</li>
                        <li>- Find ways to be fulfilled in areas of life beyond academic performance metrics</li>
                        <li>- Set short term regularly attainable goals</li>
                        <li>- Try to be kind to yourself everyday, times are tough!</li>   
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3><b>TAKE ACTION TODAY</b></h3>

                <p>In the blandness and isolation of what we see in our daily lives, and the negativity, turmoil, and finger-pointing that we see on our screens, it has been ridiculously easy, even inevitable, to fall into a hole of loneliness. And the more we think that our situations are beginning to define who we are, the deeper that hole becomes. Aim to survive these circumstances without surrendering yourself to them; you can hit pause on this mental state by caring for someone else - who could use a chat right now?</p>

                <p>Think about the people in your life who mean the most to you, and this includes yourself. How long has it been since you last talked to someone you care for, or done something to make yourself happy? If your answer is “too long,” as many of ours often is, you know what to do. Otherwise, consider this: make it a point to regularly check your Facebook calendar for birthdays, and wish someone a happy birthday every day. This year for Bell Let’s Talk, in addition to caring for our own well-being, let’s turn our attention outward as well.</p>

                <p>Every day, you have the opportunity to make someone else’s.</p>
