                March 17th, 2020, I travelled across the globe, back to my home country India, after staying for a good 8 months in Canada for the sole purpose of education at the University of Toronto. I travelled on an emergency visa and in an absolute hurry so as to get back to my family before all international flights would close down in light of the COVID-19 global pandemic. Little did I know that the conditions would worsen over the course of the next few weeks, to such an extent that it would be dangerous to travel back to Canada for the next Semester of University. So now, I’m stuck 7000 miles away from Toronto, and will be attending all classes in the Fall term remotely.Being an International Student studying online from their home country brings with it a mixed bag of emotions. With the world lying on the brink of uncertainty, there is a sense of security that is felt in being close to your loved ones, and that is one of the biggest advantages of studying from home. Apart from that, we save a lot of otherwise lost time in commuting to class everyday, hence sparing some extra time for ourselves, and to engage in activities outside of the boundaries of academia.

                Having said this, there are a myriad of downsides with regard to studying from your home country. One of the major inconveniences that we face is living in an altogether different timezone, and having to make various adjustments to our sleep schedules and timetables in order to cope with time differences ranging from 1 to almost 12 hours from the Eastern Standard Time. We are all well aware of the amount of toil that goes into maintaining good grades at the University of Toronto. We are required to collaborate with our classmates on an almost everyday basis, reach out for assistance from our Professors and TA’s, and many a times avail the multiple academic resources provided to us by the University. Unfortunately, taking classes online makes it extremely difficult to do any of the above, hence taking the academic pressure a notch higher.                 </p>

                As an international student, I can confirm that coming to a different country for your education is a very meticulous process. Following through with this process and choosing to leave the comfort of your home and your loved ones to travel to a foreign place is a very difficult transition to make and puts you in a very uncomfortable situation. Moving to a new country provides exposure to the language, food, lifestyle and people there, and helps in expanding the horizons of your knowledge of life as a whole. Moreover, attending a University like our own allows a student to be exposed to a variety of people from different social, cultural and economic backgrounds. You need to learn to live, adjust and grow with these people, who become an essential part of your learning experience and open the gates of your mind to multitudes of opinions, ideals, morals and perspectives. All of these changes in the life of a student helps to stimulate their personal growth. And it is mainly for this purpose that students spend a fortune on their education abroad. With the pandemic looming around us, international students have to end up paying the same amount of fee, but suffer a massive loss in the experience of studying abroad, which is one of the greatest drawbacks of online education.                </p>

                All in all, getting used to online studies from one’s home country In the midst of these unprecedented times is a bittersweet journey. But the one thing we can do To make it easier for ourselves is to make a conscious effort to remind ourselves to be grateful for being close to our loved ones and having the privilege of receiving education despite all the chaos around us. Staying positive and having faith that things will eventually get better, and that we will soon be back at University, studying with our friends, is how we keep ourselves going.                </p>
